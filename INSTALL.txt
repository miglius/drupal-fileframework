NOTE: This is experimental software meant for advanced users; assume nothing
works, and you may be pleasantly surprised. And when it breaks, you get to
keep both pieces.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Requires Drupal 6.x and the following modules:

  Bitcache
  <http://drupal.org/project/bitcache>

  RDF
  <http://drupal.org/project/rdf>


INSTALLATION
------------

  1. Copy all the module files into a subdirectory called
     sites/all/modules/fileframework/

  2. Go to [Administer >> Site building >> Modules] and enable the RDF,
     Bitcache and File Framework modules. Press the "Save configuration"
     button.

  4. Go to [Administer >> Site configuration >> Files] to review and
     change the configuration options to your liking.

  5. (See README.txt for information on submitting bug reports.)


ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE
-------------------
Folowing software is optional, but highly recommended:

  getID3 (if getID3 module is mot installed)
  <http://getid3.sourceforge.net>

  Flowplayer
  <http://flowplayer.org>

  XSPF Player (Slim version)
  <http://musicplayer.sourceforge.net>

  MindMapMacro
  <http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Macros/MindMapMacro>

This software should be extracted under the 'vendor' folder.


STORAGE OPTIONS
---------------
To re-configure File Framework to use another Bitcache storage backend (for
example, to store your files on Amazon S3 instead of on the file system),
follow these instructions:

  1. Install File Framework normally per the instructions given above.

  2. Go to [Administer >> Site configuration >> Data storage] and create a
     new Bitcache repository. You may use any of the available repository
     backends (a.k.a. storage adapters) and you can name the repository
     anything you like.

  3. Go to [Administer >> Site configuration >> Files] and choose your
     newly-created repository from the "Repository" drop-down box. Press the
     "Save configuration" button.

  4. Go to [Administer >> Site configuration >> Data storage] and delete the
     old Bitcache repository (called "File framework") which was
     automatically created when you installed File Framework.

     (Alternatively, you can let this repository continue existing, in which
     case File Framework will continue looking up any existing file data
     from it, but will store new files in the new repository you've
     indicated.)
