REQUIREMENTS
------------
Requires Drupal 6.x and the following modules:

  Bitcache
  <http://drupal.org/project/bitcache>

  RDF API
  <http://drupal.org/project/rdf>


INSTALLATION
------------

  1. Copy all the module files into a subdirectory called modules/fileframework/
     under your Drupal installation directory.

  2. Go to Administer >> Site building >> Modules and enable the RDF API,
     RDF DB, and Bitcache modules. Press the "Save configuration" button.

  3. Still on the same page, enable the File module, and press the
     "Save configuration" button. Note that this *must* be done only after
     the aforementioned dependent modules have been previously enabled, as
     you'll likely run into error messages otherwise.

  4. Go to Administer >> Site configuration >> Files to review and
     change the configuration options to your liking.

  5. (See README.txt for information on submitting bug reports.)
